# signin BROKEN NOT MIGRATED TO THISSTACK
## expanding signin as an admin tool

What if you build a device and what to add it to the ecosystem? you are then god. You can sell it to somebody. then they own it.

Currently it gives you back all the locations you have apps and then a list of your apps at a particular location.

It might be able to get a list of devices you own. If you own it you can add a user of an admin or an app bulder.

Then an app builder can see the locations and devices he can build for. He can then create an app for that location or add devices from an location to that app ie and app_loc entry in the database.

If you have app_loc_user entry you might own something. Can we check? for a location? After all the app builder needs to know the resources available at a location. He says , hey I'm gonna build an app for you? I'll call it xxxx. can you add me as an app builder for that location?
