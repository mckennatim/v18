# v18-node19.4.0-npm9.3 

Upgraded from work of [READMEv17](READMEv17.md) which was mostly for tcard. It replaces navigo with history, and redux with context as described in [READMEresponsive_context.md](READMEresponsive_context.md)

Started this stack mainly to get iot (mqtt-hooks and react-zonetimer) running. 

`nvm use` switches to the version listed in .nvmrc
