### Edgewater Water Control
\
Edgewater Water Control (EWC) generally operates without WIFI/internet with default settings for successive watering of zone 1, 2, 3 & 4. The current default setting is 60 minutes (3600 sec) for each zone</p>

On startup, EWC does search for a WIFI connection for about 4 minutes before it is ready to operate.</p>
